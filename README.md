## Instructions

1. Open get_taylor.py and insert your API key. Normally I would have removed the ones I used but we don't really care about information security on this so its fine lol

2. Run get_taylor.py with different API query parameters. Each execution creates a new twsift_articles_*datetime*.json file
3. Run get_articles_consolidated.py to consolidate different query results under one CSV file
